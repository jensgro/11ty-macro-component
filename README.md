# 11ty - Test for macros and components

- [nunjucks macros](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#macro)
- [components](https://www.trysmudford.com/blog/encapsulated-11ty-components/)
- [catch-all-component](https://github.com/trys/11ty-component-macro)

------------

## Initial position

The master-branch has no component included. The other branches are dealing with different approaches to tackle the problem of integrating components/html snippets without using custom elements. As I don't want to become dependent on JavaScript in the resulting page I don't want to use custom elements.

- **Test Nr. 1** (Branch: test-nr1) **didn't work**. It was an implementation of the [catch-all-component](https://github.com/trys/11ty-component-macro).
- **Test Nr. 2** (Branch: test-nr2) **did work**. 
- **Test Nr. 3** (Branch: test-nr3) **didn't work**.
